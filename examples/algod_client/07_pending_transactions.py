Example: Pending Transactions

This example demonstrates how to query pending transactions in the transaction
pool using pending_transactions() and pending_transactions_by_address(). Pending
transactions are those that have been submitted but not yet confirmed in a block.

Prerequisites:
- LocalNet running (via `algokit localnet start`)
