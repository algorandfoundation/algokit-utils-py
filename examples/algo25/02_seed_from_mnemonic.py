Example: Seed from Mnemonic

This example demonstrates how to use seed_from_mnemonic() to convert a 25-word
Algorand mnemonic back to its original 32-byte seed. This is the reverse
operation of mnemonic_from_seed().

Key concepts:
- seed_from_mnemonic() reverses the mnemonic encoding process
- The checksum word is verified to ensure mnemonic integrity
- Round-trip conversion: seed -> mnemonic -> seed produces identical bytes

No LocalNet required - pure utility function
