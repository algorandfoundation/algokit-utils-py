Example: Sourcemap for TEAL Debugging

This example demonstrates how to use ProgramSourceMap for mapping TEAL
program counters (PC) to source locations for debugging purposes.

Topics covered:
- ProgramSourceMap class construction from sourcemap data
- Sourcemap format: version, sources, mappings
- get_line_for_pc() to get source line for a specific PC
- get_pcs_for_line() to find PCs for a source line
- pc_to_line and line_to_pc dictionaries
- How sourcemaps enable TEAL debugging by mapping PC to source

No LocalNet required - pure sourcemap parsing
