Example: Logic Signature

This example demonstrates how to use a logic signature (lsig) to authorize transactions.

Key concepts:
- Compiling a TEAL program using algod.teal_compile()
- Creating a LogicSig from compiled program bytes
- Understanding the logic signature address (derived from program hash)
- Funding and using a logic signature as a standalone account
- Creating a delegated logic signature where an account delegates signing to a program

Logic signatures allow transactions to be authorized by a program instead of (or in addition to)
a cryptographic signature. This enables smart contracts that can hold and send funds based
purely on program logic.

Prerequisites:
- LocalNet running (via `algokit localnet start`)
