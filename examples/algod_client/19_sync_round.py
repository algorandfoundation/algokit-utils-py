Example: Sync Round Management

This example demonstrates how to manage the sync round using:
- sync_round() - Get the minimum sync round the ledger will cache
- set_sync_round(round) - Set the minimum sync round
- unset_sync_round() - Unset/reset the sync round

What is the sync round?
The sync round is a configuration that controls the minimum round the node
will keep data for. When set, the node will:
- Only keep block data from this round onwards
- Allow old block data to be deleted/pruned
- Reduce storage requirements for archival data

This is useful for:
- Nodes that only need recent data (not full archival history)
- Indexers that only need data from a specific point forward
- Applications that don't need ancient historical data

Key concepts:
- sync_round() returns GetSyncRoundResponse with round_ attribute
- set_sync_round(round) sets the minimum round to keep
- unset_sync_round() removes the sync round restriction
- Historical data below the sync round may be unavailable

Prerequisites:
- LocalNet running (via `algokit localnet start`)

Note: On some nodes, these endpoints may require admin privileges
or return errors if the feature is not supported.
