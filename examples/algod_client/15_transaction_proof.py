"""
Example: Transaction Proof

This example demonstrates how to get transaction proofs using:
- transaction_proof(round, tx_id) - Get the Merkle proof for a transaction

Transaction proofs are cryptographic proofs that a transaction is included in a specific
block. They are used for light client verification, allowing clients to verify transaction
inclusion without downloading the entire blockchain.

The proof uses a Merkle tree structure where:
- Each transaction in a block is a leaf in the tree
- The root of the tree is committed in the block header
- The proof provides the sibling hashes needed to reconstruct the root

Prerequisites:
- LocalNet running (via `algokit localnet start`)
